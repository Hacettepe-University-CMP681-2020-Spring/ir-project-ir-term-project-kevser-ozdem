In this study, it is aimed to determine the best deep learning model suitable for contextual IR.
Widely used deep learning approaches are compared both through a literature review and also through experiments.
CNN, RNN, and LSTM models are used for experiments.
The model can be trained by train.py. It is optional to use cnn.py or lstm.py to train the model.
